## 🌍 **What is Chris & Tom Datadom?**  
Welcome to **Chris & Tom Datadom**, a self-hosted server project running in an environment where **redundancy meets reliability**, and where data is handled with the same care as a **perfectly wired rack**.  

We believe in **learning by doing**, **sharing knowledge**, and most importantly—**keeping things running, no matter what**. Whether it's an experiment, a playground for open-source tech, or a fortress of uptime, we've got it covered.

## 🏗️ **What’s Inside the Datadom?**  

🖥️ **Self-hosted everything** – Because trusting a cloud is nice, but **being the cloud** is better.  
🔧 **Built on FOSS** – Proprietary software? Laat maar zitten.  
🛡️ **Secure & stable** – Just like that well-documented firewall rule.  
📡 **Network-first mindset** – Routes optimized, packets respected.  
🤖 **Automation & monitoring** – Because **efficiency > repetition**.

## 🚀 **Why Chris & Tom Datadom?**  

✅ **Built with knowledge & community in mind**  
Chris & Tom Datadom isn’t just another self-hosted project—it’s an infrastructure designed to **enable learning, collaboration, and real-world experimentation**. Inspired by **VCH-Infra**, we believe that the best way to push innovation forward is to **make powerful tools accessible, document them well, and share knowledge freely**.  

✅ **A research-grade modular infrastructure**  
Much like **VCH-Infra**, this ecosystem is designed to **streamline research, development, and hosting**, integrating a mix of **virtualization, data analysis, automation, and security tools**. Every component is modular, open-source, and **built to support real-world applications**, whether for **academia, network engineering, or tech-driven research**.  

✅ **Carefully managed infrastructure, not just thrown together**  
Some people spin up a server and hope for the best. We **plan, optimize, and iterate**.  
- **Containerized everything** with Docker and Kubernetes for **scalability**.  
- **Automated provisioning** using Ansible to **reduce manual workload**.  
- **Real-time monitoring** with Grafana & Prometheus to **catch issues before they escalate**.  
- **Modular networking setup**, integrating BGP and VPNs for **secure and flexible access**.  

✅ **Reliability that won't ghost you at 2 AM**  
The best infrastructure is the one that **doesn’t need late-night intervention**. That’s why we **design for uptime and resilience** from day one:  
- **Load balancing & failover strategies** to keep services running.  
- **Automated alerts** for rapid troubleshooting.  
- **Version-controlled deployments** to prevent configuration drift.  

🔍 **We like to say:**  
*"If you can document it, you can improve it. If you can automate it, even better. If you don’t need to wake up for it, you’ve done it right."*
