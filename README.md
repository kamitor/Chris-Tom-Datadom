## 🌍 **What is Chris & Tom Datadom?**  
Welcome to **Chris & Tom Datadom**, a self-hosted server project running in an environment where **redundancy meets reliability**, and where data is handled with the same care as a **perfectly wired rack**.  

We believe in **learning by doing**, **sharing knowledge**, and most importantly—**keeping things running, no matter what**. Whether it's an experiment, a playground for open-source tech, or a fortress of uptime, we've got it covered.

🛡️ **Secure & stable** – Just like that well-documented firewall rule.  
📡 **Network-first mindset** – Routes optimized, packets respected.  
🤖 **Automation & monitoring** – Because **efficiency > repetition**.
